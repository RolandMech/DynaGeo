"POWERED BY DELPHI" button images
Package-Version 2.3 from 07-Mar-99

Join the "POWERED BY DELPHI" campaign by putting the corresponding
"Button" in your applications' About-boxes - thus demonstrating
the Power of Delphi as development tool.

These images have been created by various Delphi-Programmers and sent
to me for public domain. You are not only free, but even *invited* to
use them on your website or especially in your Delphi programs.

If you use these images, I'd be happy if you would put a link to my
website, the "Delphi-Box" somewhere on your pages, in your Readme
file or your application.
