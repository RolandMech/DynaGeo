## DynaGeo

The interactive geometry and calculus application created by Roland Mechling.
Former shareware, but now open source!

## Building the Project

Since DynaGeo is written in Delphi, this project needs the Delphi IDE from Embarcadero to be compiled.
Fortunately, they offer a free [Community Edition](https://www.embarcadero.com/free-tools?aldSet=en-GB) for non-commercial use.

Besides the Delphi IDE, DynaGeo needs the [ZipForge](https://componentace.com/download/download.php?editionid=12) component to be installed.
Therefore, _after_ installing Delphi, download the version of ZipForge that matches the IDE's Delphi version and install it.

After installing both tools, launch _Delphi Community Edition_ and locate the `DynaGeo.dproj`-File in the cloned repository's root directory.
Choose either `Run->Run` or `Run->Run Without Debugging` to compile and start DynaGeo.

Have fun! :)
