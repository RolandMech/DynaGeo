<P>First you must select the object to be deleted by clicking on it with the mouse. If other objects are being constructed from it, these objects will be shown in a green colour, and the program will ask if you really want to delete all these objects. If <i>Yes</i>, they are deleted all together, otherwise they are all left alive.</P>

<P>If you wish to delete an object, and there are no other objects depending on it, this object is deleted immediately when you click on it.</P>

<P>However, if you try to <b>delete the co-ordinate system</b>, only the fixing of the co-ordinate points will be deleted: all points with fixed co-ordinates will be converted into basis points. Finally the co-ordinate system is hidden. If you wish to keep the co-ordinate points fixed, you have to use the command <i>Hide / show object</i> to hide the co-ordinate system.</P>
