<H2>Problems with printing</H2>
<HR>

<P><B>a) Why do some objects not appear in the print-out ?</B></P>

<blockquote><P>When a EUKLID DynaGeo drawing is sent to a monochrome printer, then the screen colours are changed into grey scales by the printer driver. The resultant print quality depends almost entirely on how well the driver does its job. You should test to see which colours print out best, and then use this knowledge when colouring the drawing. </P>

<P>When for example, the co-ordinate system is missing from your print-out, even though displayed on the screen, then this shows that the printer driver interprets the light grey (standard colour) of the co-ordinate system as white. (This may even be true for some older colour printers.) In that case use another colour for the co-ordinate system (such as black), then it should print correctly.</P>

<P><B>b) Why do my dashed lines become solid when printed?</B></P>

<blockquote><P>Many older printers cannot produce dashed or dotted lines. If this is true for your printer too, EUKLID DynaGeo can simulate these attributes when printing. If you choose the appropriate options on the <nobr><a href="optexport.htm">Export page</a></nobr> of the <nobr><i>Options dialogue</i></nobr>, the program produces a series of short solid segments instead of one dashed line.</P>
