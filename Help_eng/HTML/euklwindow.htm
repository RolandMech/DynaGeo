<H2>The EUKLID DynaGeo window</H2>
<HR>

<P>EUKLID DynaGeo is a simple WINDOWS program than can be run either in a window or as a full screen application. The window's <b>Title bar</b> shows the program title followed by the name of the EUKLID DynaGeo file <i>(*.GEO)</i> currently displayed. If the drawing board is still empty or the current drawing has never been saved before, then the filename <i>NONAME.GEO</i> is displayed.</p>

<p>Below the title bar there is the <b>Main menu</b>. Every one of its entries leads to a pull-down menu, which unrolls when the appropriate Main menu entry is clicked. Under the Main menu the <b>Tool bar</b> is displayed that allows a comfortable access to the commands most often used. The command icons are distributed among several tool bar pages that cover different tasks or working situations.</p>

<p>At the bottom of the window appears the <b>Status bar</b> where the current status of the program is shown. Additionally the current cursor position is shown to the left of the status bar. When you apply a command, the Status bar always shows hints about the actually expected input data for this command.</p>

<P>The area between the toolbar and the status bar contains the actual <b>drawing board</b>, where you can construct your drawing.
