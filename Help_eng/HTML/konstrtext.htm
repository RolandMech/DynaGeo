<HR>

<P>This command displays a window in which a construction description of the present drawing is listed. One line of text is given for every object constructed. (This is the same text which is also displayed as an object description during <a href="rueckblende.htm"><i>Replay</i></a>). The description of hidden objects is shown in simple round brackets. If an object is invalid then its description is enclosed in double curly brackets.</P>

<P>The window size and position can be changed. Though the text cannot be edited, it can be marked and then with CTRL-INSERT copied into the clipboard. From there it can be transferred to a word processor for further editing. Additionally, the window offers a <b><font color="#0000FF">search function</font></b>:<br>
<br>
<ul>A <b>double click with the left mouse button</b> on any word of the text will mark the whole line this word is in. Then the object described in this line will start <b>blinking</b>.<br>
<br>
After having marked a line, you can move the marking up and down with the <b>cursor keys</b> (oder the mouse wheel) and thus go through the whole construction, while always the marked object is blinking.</ul></p>
<br>

<P>To continue working on the drawing, the construction text window must be closed.</P>
