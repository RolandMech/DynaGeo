<P>EUKLID DynaGeo is shareware. It is distributed in a compressed archive file via the Internet. The shareware version may (and should) be copied and re-distributed on condition that all files contained in the original archive are included. You may use the program for 8 weeks to test its suitability. If after this time you want to continue using EUKLID DynaGeo, you must buy a license. The use of the shareware version in schools and similar educational establishments is strictly prohibited.</U></P>

<P>Registered users receive their personal license data to convert the shareware to a licensed version. Moreover, they get updates to a higher main version number at a discount, if not even for free. Additionally, registered users can receive latest updates within the main version number (e.g. 2.x)&xnbsp;free. See also: <a href="UPDATE.HTM">How do I get an update?</a>).</P>
<ul>
<li><p>A <font color="#FF0000"><b>single user license</b></font> costs <b>Euro 25,--</b> and allows the use of the program within the usual conditions (on one computer at a time, similar to the use of a book).</p></li>

<li><p>An <font color="#FF0000"><b>extended school license</b></font> costs <b>Euro 125,--</b> and allows not only the use of the program on all computers and local area networks within the school, but also on the private computers of all teachers and students of that school.</p></li>
</ul>
<P>These prices are only valid outside the European community. If you live inside the EC, please have a look at the <a href="http://www.dynageo.com">DynaGeo homepage</a> to get the actual prices.</P>

<P>To avoid difficulties with payment, I gave EUKLID DynaGeo to <a href="http://www.shareit.com">ShareIt</a>, a professional shareware distribution service. Thus you can choose between different paying modes. Especially, you can buy a license online with your credit card. If you are interested in an EUKLID DynaGeo license, please have a look at the "English pages" of the <a href="http://www.dynageo.com">DynaGeo homepage!</a></P>

<P>I have prepared the program with the greatest possible care. However, I cannot guarantee freedom from error. I also cannot take any legal responsibility or liability of any kind for damage caused by use of this program, even if caused by a program error, or errors in the documentation. I also undertake no guarantee that the program functions will meet the expectations of the user, or that the program runs without error.<br>
<br>
But, as I am interested in customers satisfied with EUKLID DynaGeo, I would thank you for any information concerning possible errors, or suggestions about possible improvements. Just send me an <nobr><a href="mailto:roland@mechling.de">e-mail</a>!</nobr></P>
