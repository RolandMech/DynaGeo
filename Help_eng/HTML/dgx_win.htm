<H2>Does DynaGeoX modify my WINDOWS?</H2>
<HR>

<P>When the Internet Explorer (IE) has to display a HTML page that needs an <B>ActiveX component</B>, first of all WINDOWS is asked if the component's executable file is already available in the local operating system. If it is, the IE will use this local copy. Otherwise the HTML page contains a link to a "code base". Usually this is an internet address indicating where the component's executable file can be downloaded from. If necessary the file is fetched from there, unpacked, installed and registered. Now the ActiveX component can be displayed inside the HTML page. </P>

<P>Fortunately, the installation of a downloaded ActiveX component is done rather transparent: all these components are saved to the directory "%windir%\Downloaded Program Files". If you start the Explorer, open this directory and delete one of the listed components, not only the file is deleted but the appropriate registry entries are removed too. So you can get rid of such an ActiveX component later without any problems.</P>

<p><h3>Hints for computers <u>with</u> Internet access:</h3>
</p>
<ul>
<p>If you want to assure that on your system an actual version of DynaGeoX is installed, the easiest way is to visit the "Gallery" on the <a href="http://www.dynageo.com/">EUKLID DynaGeo homepage</a>. If you browse to the "Installation page" your system is checked automatically. If necessary DynaGeoX is installed (resp. updated). Before the installation is carried out, you are asked if you really want the component to be installed. In some cases, an additional warning will appear that the DynaGeoX component is "not trustworthy". This is due to an error in the certification management of Microsoft. I admit that in this situation it takes a bit of courage to nevertheless install it. But there is no other way: if you want to use DynaGeoX, you must trust its programmer! </p>
</ul>

<p><h3>Hints for computers <u>without</u> Internet access:</h3>
</p>
<ul>
<p>Even if your computer has no Internet access you need not do without DynaGeoX. To install it on your computer, start the IE and load the file "InstallDynaGeoXViewer.html" located in the subdirectory "viewer" of your EUKLID DynaGeo directory. When the page is displayed test if you can drag the drawing. If this is the fact, the installation was successful.</p>
