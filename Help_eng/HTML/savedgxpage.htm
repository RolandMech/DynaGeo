<H2>Save as DynaGeoX HTML page...</H2>
<HR>

<P>This commands allows to <B>export a drawing to a DynaGeoX HTML document</B>. When you load such a document into your Internet Explorer, the IE will use the <B>DynaGeoX-Viewer</B> to display your dynamic drawing inside the HTML page. Choosing this command will open a dialog box where you can enter the options of the new HTML page:</P>
<br>

<UL>
        <LI><B>Target path for the HTML file:<BR>
</B>Initially this field shows the full path to your current drawing, but with the extension "<i>.html</i>" instead of "<i>.geo</i>". You can edit this path as you like, but the extension needs to be "<i>.html</i>" (oder "<i>.htm</i>").<BR>
<BR><BR></LI>

        <LI><B>Path to the DynaGeoX Viewer:<BR>
</B>This path must point to an actual version of the DynaGeoX Viewer. Normally you find a suitable file in the sub-directory <I>Viewer</I> of your DynaGeo directory. You can choose from two standard paths to the Viewer: the <b>local</b> one has the advantage that the Viewer can be called without any Internet access; on the other hand, the <b>Internet</b> path assures that you always work with the last recent version of the Viewer.<BR>
<BR><BR></LI>

        <LI><B>Text above the DynaGeoX object:<BR>
</B>Here you can enter any desired text. Hard line breaks (by pressing <i>ENTER</i>) are automatically converted to HTML breaks (”&lt;br&gt;”). If you use HTML tags to format your text, these tags will be preserved.<BR>
<BR><BR></LI>

        <LI><B>Viewer window:<BR>
</B>Here you can adjust the width and height (in pixels) of the Viewer window. You should not size the window bigger than necessary, to make sure that your HTML page can also be displayed on smaller screens. Whenever you call the command "Save as DynaGeoJ HTML page" the width and size of the DynaGeoJ object are preset according to the following rules:<BR>
<br>
<ul>
<li>If you had drawn a <u>selection frame</u> before, then its width and height are taken as preset values for the DynageoJ object size.</li>
<li>If there is no selection frame, but the <u>target HTML file exists already</u>, then DynaGeo tries to take over the values of width and height from this file.</li>
<li>If the target file does not exist yet, and the DynaGeo program does not appear maximized on the screen, then the width and height of the actual drawing window are taken as preset values.</li>
<li>In any other case the width is set to 500 pixels and the height to 350 pixels.<br>
<br></li>
</ul>
So it is appropriate to draw a selection frame <u>before</u> calling the command "Save as DynaGeoJ HTML page". Alternatively, you can also resize the DynaGeo window itself in order to let it show just the right part of your drawing. Then it is not necessary to change the size values manually.<br>
<BR><BR></LI>

        <LI><B>Viewer commands: <BR>
</B>A click on this button opens a window, where you can choose from a list of commands which of them you want to be available in the viewer window. At runtime, the viewer will display a tool buttons for every selected command. These tool buttons will be placed in a vertical panel on the left side of the viewer window. <br>
When <u>no</u> commands are selected, this tool panel is hidden and the whole viewer window space is available to your drawing. When you try to select <u>too much</u> commands and not all tool buttons find place in the the tool panel, then you get a warning. <BR>
<BR><BR></LI>

        <LI><B>Author's name:<BR>
</B>Whatever you enter here will be written to an appropriate "META" tag in the "HEAD" section of your HTML document. If you leave this field empty, then no such "META" tag will be created. But if you want to publish your document in the Internet it's a matter of "netiquette" to sign it with your name. <br></LI>
</UL>
<br>
<P>When all options have been set to the desired values, a click on the button <I>Save</I> will create the HTML file containing a complete HTML page with a DynaGeoX object tag. If the file already exists, only the new information is added to the existing file.<br>
Additionally, the actual GEO file is saved too, to update it and register the selected viewer commands if necessary. </P>
