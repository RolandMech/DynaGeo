<H2>Create a new macro</H2>
<HR>

<P>Before creating a new macro you have to carry out the complete construction that later should be constructed by this macro. Then the macro is created in three steps:</P>
<br>

<OL>
        <LI>Upon selecting the <i>create new macro</i> command, a small window is opened in the working area. The only button of this window is <i>Ok, done!</i>. Now you must click on the <b>start objects</b> of the macro. If a start object required is hidden behind the <i>Ok, done!</i> window, you can move this window to a different position on the screen by <A HREF="JavaScript:HHCTRL.TextPopup(pop_drag,popfont,10,10,-1,-1)"
Title="Click to see a definition!">dragging</A> it.<br>
<br>
If the selection of a start object is not unique, a window is opened displaying the possible relevant objects. Select the object from the list.<br>
<br>
When all the start objects you need for the macro are selected, click the <i>Ok, done!</i> button. <BR>
<BR><BR></LI>

        <LI>After you have selected all your start objects the title bar of the <i>Ok, done!</i> button window changes: you are now requested to select the <b>target objects</b> for the macro in the same way you selected the start objects. Click on the <i>Ok, done!</i> button to finish this selection process, too.<br>
<br>
If you select a target object which cannot be derived from the start objects, an error message appears on the screen, and the creation of the macro is canceled.<br>
<BR><BR></LI>

        <LI>Finally a bigger dialogue box is opened, in which the <b>name</b> of the macro and a <b>help text</b> may be typed. This name is the menu item that will be appended to the macro menu after the macro is correctly built. The corresponding help text is displayed at any time you ask for help about this macro. This can be done by clicking the F1 key while running the macro.<br>
<br>
The available key commands to format the help text are explained on the page <a href="specialkeys.htm"><nobr>Hot keys</nobr></a>.
</LI>
</OL>
<br>

<P>After you have completed these three steps, the macro is build and added as a new entry to the macro menu.</P>
