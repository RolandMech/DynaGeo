<H2>Create a new textbox</H2>
<HR>

<P>This command displays an <b>editor window</b> in which any desired text may be put. When the window is closed, the text is displayed in your drawing in a rectangular area but without a frame. The size of this <b>textbox</b> is defined during the editing phase. The box is as wide as the editor window from which it receives its text, and high enough to contain the entire text. It may be <A HREF="JavaScript:HHCTRL.TextPopup(pop_drag,popfont,10,10,-1,-1)" Title="Click to see a definition!">dragged</A> with the mouse, and so placed at another location.</P>

<p>Additionally, you can bind the textbox to an object of your drawing (see <a href="bindtext2obj.htm">Snap textbox to object</a>). Then it will follow all movements of this object.</p>

<P>The textbox can also be worked on. A double click with the left mouse button in the text displays the editor window again, where the text can be changed or a new width set.</P>
<br>

<p>The <b>context menu</b> of a textbox holds the following items:<br>
<ul>
<li><b>Hide </b>:<br>
<ul>This command allows to hide the textbox the same way as with all the other objects of your drawing.<br>
</ul><br>
</li>
<li><b>Colour... </b>:<br>
<ul>This brings up a colour dialogue to choose the text's colour. Please note that there is only <u>one</u> colour for the whole of the text.<br>
</ul><br>
</li>
<li><b>Edit... </b>:<br>
<ul>allows to edit the contents of the text box. This is equivalent to a double click on the textbox. <br>
</ul><br>
</li>
<li><b>Snap textbox to object...</b> resp. <b>Unsnap textbox from object</b> :<br>
<ul>If the textbox is still unbound, it can be snapped to an object of your drawing. Just indicate the object the textbox is to be bound to. The other command will release a bound textbox and convert it back to a free one. <br>
</ul><br>
</li>
</ul>
</p>
<br>
<br>
<P><font color="#FF0000"><b><i>Please note:</i></b></font>
<ul>Textboxes can considerably reduce the program performance in drag mode. Therefore use them with care and only sparingly. (A textbox can theoretically hold up to 10000 characters, but you’d better not try this!) You may however hide textboxes like normal EUKLID DynaGeo objects, and only make them visible when required. </ul>
