<H2>Show / hide set square&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<IMG SRC="../images/geo3eck2.bmp" ALT="" BORDER=0></H2>
<HR>

<P>This command shows a <b>transparent set square</b> that lies on your drawing. The next call to this command will hide the set square again. </P>

<P>You can drag the set square with the mouse like a normal base object. When you click inside the circle line that shows the angle measures and drag the mouse, you can <b>move</b> the set square. When you take it outside of this circle line (in the corners) you can <b>rotate</b> it around its centre. If your computer is a bit slow, it may be necessary to perform this manipulation carefully and not too fast. </P>
<br>
<br>
<P><B><I>Please note:</I></B>
<ul>
<li>The set square <b>cannot interact</b> with any of the other objects of the drawing. It is purely a decoration of the drawing, serving only for demonstrations. <br>
<br></li>
<li>The set square is only available if your drawing uses an <b>isotropic co-ordinate system</b>. If you use different unit lengths on the two axes, it is hidden automatically.<br>
<br></li>
<li>To show the set square is a rather expensive task for Windows and needs a lot of system resources. So you should only show the set square as long as you really need it, and hide it immediately afterwards.<br>
<br></li>
<li>To achieve a smooth dragging of the set square, it may be necessary to activate the internal "double buffering" of DynaGeo (see "<a href="optintern.htm">Options | Internals</a>").<br>
