<P>With the left mouse button, click on the two objects you want to measure the distance between. You can choose any combination of points, lines and circles, and the objects may be selected in any order.</P>

<P>If the distance between the selected objects is positive, a so-called "line of distance" is constructed and displayed. Its length is shown in a small frame. For two intersecting lines and/or circles no line of distance is constructed. Their distance is assumed to be zero.</P>

<P>You may <A HREF="JavaScript:HHCTRL.TextPopup(pop_drag,popfont,10,10,-1,-1)" Title="Click to see a definition!">drag</A> the display frame with the mouse.

<P><b><i>Please note:</i></b>
<ul>
<li>If you want to measure the distance between <b>a line segment</b> and <b>another object</b>, internally EUKLID DynaGeo uses <b>the (long) line</b> including this segment. It is thereby easier to e.g. measure the perpendicular in all triangles.
<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>For all other combinations of points, lines and circles a correct topological concept of distance is used: The distance between two sets of points is the shortest of all distances between points of one set to points of the other set.<br>
<br>
</li>
</ul></P>
<br>
<br>
<p><b>ALT variant: Easy measuring of segment lengths</b><br>
<ul>If you start this command by clicking the tool button on the <i>Measure & Calculate bar</i>, and you hold down the <i>ALT&nbsp;key</i> while you click, then only <b>one</b> parameter will be expected: when you click on a <b>segment</b>, the <b>length</b> of this segment will be measured and displayed. </ul>
