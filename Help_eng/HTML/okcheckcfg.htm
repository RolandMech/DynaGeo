<H2>Configure correctness check</H2>
<HR>
<br>
DynaGeo provides the possibility that teacher can prepare worksheets, give them to the students, let them (try to) solve the posed problem and - finally the student itself can make DynaGeo check if his solution is correct or not. In the window "Configure correctness check" the author of such a worksheet can prepare this automatic correctness check: <br>
<br>
<br>
<ul>
<li>In the field <font color="#0000FF"><i>"condition of correctness"</i></font> you can enter a Boolean term that is true if and only if the construction is correct. Details about the syntax of Boolean terms can be found on the page <a href="boolterm.htm">Boolean terms</a>. Some examples of correctness conditions are in <a href="okcheck.htm">Basics about the correctness check</a>.<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>In the <font color="#0000FF"><i>table</i></font> below, DynaGeo inserts all of the target variables (@1, @2,....@9) that are used in the condition of correctness. Please select for every of the variables in the list, of which type the correponding target object has to be. <br>
<br>
</li>
<li>In the field <font color="#0000FF"><i>"Hint text"</i></i></font> you can enter a short help text. This text is shown to the student in the status line when he is indicating the target objects of his construction.<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>The last 2 edit fields may contain <font color="#0000FF"><i>"Links"</i></font> to a next lesson, but separate for the 2 cases of successful and not successful working on the problem. For every case you may enter the desired GEO file that contains an appropriate next worksheet. If all files are in the same folder, the file's name is sufficient. In all other cases, you should provide the <b>relative path</b> from the actual GEO file to the desired next one. <br>
You can also leave these fields blank, if there are no suitable worksheets (yet).<br>
</li>
</ul>
<br>

<p>If you leave this window by clicking on the <i>"Okay"</i> button, then the data entered are written to the drawing. A click on the <i>"Cancel"</i> button will discard your changes.</p>
