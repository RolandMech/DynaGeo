<H2>About deleting objects</H2>
<HR>

<P>When you delete an object it is no longer visible on the screen. However, it is <b>not yet physically deleted</b>, but saved internally in case you regret it was deleted. Actually, such an object internally behaves very much like a hidden object. It is not visible on the screen, and you cannot use it as a parent to construct other objects. It is only marked to be deleted soon.</P>

<P>Does EUKLID DynaGeo keep remembering all these delete-marked objects forever?</P>

<P>Of course not. As long as you do not save your drawing, you have the possibility to revive all
delete-marked objects by the command <i>Redo last undo</i>. But if there are many delete-marked objects in your drawing, they will take up space in memory and slow down the program. To avoid this, just <b>save your drawing</b>: while writing the GEO file, DynaGeo will physically delete all those delete-marked objects. But keep in mind that then these objects are <b>lost forever</b>.</P>
