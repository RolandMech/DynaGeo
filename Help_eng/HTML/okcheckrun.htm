<H2>Check correctness of construction&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<IMG SRC="../images/toolCheckSol2.gif" ALT="" BORDER=0></H2>
<HR>

<P>This command start a check if the construction of the actual drawing is correct and really solves the given problem. But this is only possible if the actual drawing contains a suitable condition of correctness. Only in this case, DynaGeo can decide about the correctness of the construction. If no condition of correctness is available, then the command is disabled and the tool button disappears. The following explanations assume that the actual drawing is a worksheet build by a teacher who is a professional DynaGeo user and so has added a valid condition of correctness to the initial drawing. You are the student, who worked on this worksheet and now wants to know, if his solution is correct.</P>

<p>First you must enter the <b>target objects</b> of the construction in the order the teacher has prepared: just take a look at the status line at the bottom of the DynaGeo window. After you entered the last target object, the <b>correctness check</b> is run. </p>

<p>Finally a window appears that shows the <b>result</b>:<br>
<ul>
<li>If your construction passed the correctness check, the solution is <b>correct</b>. If the teacher has provided a link to the next worksheet, then closing the result window will start loading this next problem. <br>
<br>
</li>
<li>If your construction failed the check, the solution is <b>wrong</b>, and this sad result is also shown in the result window. Perhaps the teacher has also provided a link to another worksheet that may help you to find the correct solution.Then you may accept this jump: closing the result window then will load this new (or old!) worksheet. But you also have the possibility to go back to the actual worksheet and try to correct your construction yourself. </li>
</ul>
