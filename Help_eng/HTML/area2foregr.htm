<HR>

<P>This command serves to manage the <B>mutual overlapping</B> of areas.<br>
If you start this command and click on an area that is partially covered by another area, then the clicked area is <b>brought into the foreground</b> and so becomes entirely visible.</P>

<p>It is even possible to bring an area to the foreground that is totally covered by one or more other areas.But to do this you must know the area's name. When at the spot you click there are two or more areas, DynaGeo will show you a list which you can choose the desired area from.<br>
<font size="-1">Every area gets an internal name of the form "F_n" where n is a unique number, e.g. "F_1", "F_2", "F_3",.... Normally, higher numbers belong to areas created later. Perhaps this may help you to identify the desired area's name.</font></p>
