<H2>Licensing a shareware version</H2>
<HR>
<br>
<P>You can convert a shareware version of EUKLID DynaGeo into a licensed one if only you have a valid license data file. The easiest way is: <b>Just copy your DGL file into the EUKLID DynaGeo directory.</b> If you have a newer WINDOWS version (like NT4, 2000, XP, ...), then it is necessary that you log in as "administrator" to be able to do this. If you log in as a normal user, it is likely that you don't have any write access to the "Programs" directory and its subdirectories. With the old WINDOWS versions (like 95, 98, ME) there are no such difficulties because their system directories are not write-protected at all. When you copied your DGL file to the EUKLID DynaGeo directory, the program will appear as licensed full version the next time you start it.</P>

<ul><font size="-1">If you don't want to do this copying yourself, EUKLID DynaGeo can do it for you. Just go to the <i>Help</i> menu and choose the item <i>Registration</i>; search your computer for your DGL file (with the button <i>Browse...</i>). When the edit field holds the full path to an existing DGL file and you click the button <i>Register</i>, a copy of this file is written into the EUKLID DynaGeo directory. When after the next program start EUKLID DynaGeo will run as a licensed version, the menu item <i>Registration</i> will have disappeared from the <i>Help</i> menu: it is no longer needed then!</font></ul>

<P>The <b>DGL file</b> with your personal license does not need to find its way to you on a physical data medium. The normal way is that you receive it per e-mail, as an attachment. Then let your e-mail program save the attachment at a place on your hard disk where you are able to find it again later - or just save it directly into your EUKLID DynaGeo directory!</P>

<P><font color="#FF0000"><b><i>But in any case: Save your DGL license file!</i></b></font><br>
<ul>Please make an <b>external backup</b> of your DGL file! It contains your personal license. You can e.g. burn a copy of this file onto a writeable CD, then write-protect the medium, label it as "DynaGeo license disk" and store it in a safe place. With the help of this CD you can re-install your licensed version of EUKLID DynaGeo even after a total crash of your computer's hard disk. </ul></P>
<br>

<P><u>Distribution of the installed full version or of the license data outside the validation area of the appropriate license is forbidden.</u> Especially the DGL must not be distributed outside the area covered by the license.</P>

<P>If you want to give the Shareware version to someone else, you'd better pass on only the address of EUKLID DynaGeo's Homepage:
<UL>
<B><a href="http://www.dynageo.de">http://www.dynageo.com</a></B>
</UL>
There, everybody can download an actual shareware version of the program himself.</P>
