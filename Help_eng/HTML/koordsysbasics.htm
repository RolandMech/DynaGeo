<H2>Further details about the co-ordinate system</H2>
<HR>

<P>Every EUKLID DynaGeo drawing contains a <B>cartesian co-ordinate system</B> with a unit length of 1 cm. The co-ordinate system may moved around by <A HREF="JavaScript:HHCTRL.TextPopup(pop_drag,popfont,10,10,-1,-1)" Title="Click to see a definition!">dragging</A> the origin with the mouse. Then then axes and all of the constructed objects will also move. Only number objects, term objects and unbound text boxes stay at their respective places: they are not tied to the co-ordinate system but to the window! </P>

<P>You may hide the co-ordinate system, but it is <B>always available</B>. This means that you can construct a point with determined co-ordinates even if no co-ordinate system is displayed. Furthermore, the co-ordinate system cannot be deleted. </P>

<P>Changing the drawing's size will re-scale the co-ordinate system too. Though EUKLID DynaGeo initially tries to draw a co-ordinate system with a unit length of 1 cm, the co-ordinate system displayed on your screen may not meet this requirement. This is due to WINDOWS working with "logical units" instead of "real units". But if you print your drawing, the distances are to appear correctly on the paper. </P>
