<H2>Problems at program start</H2>
<HR>

<P><B>a) Some of the menu commands are deactivated:</B></P>

<blockquote>
<P>Execute the menu command <i>Miscellaneous | Options</i>, choose the tabsheet "<a href="choosemenukonf.htm"><i>Menu configuration</i></a>", select the <i>"Standard"</i> configuration and press the <i>Apply these settings</i> button. Then all menu commands will be activated.</p>

<p>If you run EUKLID DynaGeo in a network, it may happen that you <b>cannot select</b> another menu configuration because the listbox is deactivated. In this case, please contact your administrator! He has withdrawn your permission to choose another menu configuration, and he's the one who can grant this right again. </P>

<P><B>b) Error message "The program file is corrupt."</B></P>

<blockquote>
<P>When EUKLID DynaGeo shows this error message you can be rather sure that your computer is <b>infected by a virus</b>. Even if it seems that only EUKLID DynaGeo has a problem and all other software may be running okay, <font color="#FF0000"><b>take this message very seriously!</b></font> EUKLID DynaGeo is one of the few programs that check their own integrity at every start. And it will only run from an unaltered executable file. </P>

<p>If you get this message, check your computer with an actual virus scanner software. In most cases, the miscreant will be found. Many virus scanner offer to "disinfect" the attacked files. Then you may be told that the infected files have been "repared successfully". However, it is most likely that afterwards EUKLID DynaGeo still refuses to start because the program is extremely intolerant towards changes of its executable file. So you have to reinstall it. Just  download an actual installation archive from the EUKLID DynaGeo homepage, delete DYNAGEO.EXE (and DYNAGEO.CHM) and install the program in the same directory. Please take care to leave all files with extensions ".INI" and ".DGL" untouched!</p>

<p>If no virus is found, that does not mean that there is none but only that the virus scanner has found none. Reinstall EUKLID DynaGeo like described above, and carefully look out if subsequently your computer shows any strange behaviour. </p>

<p><font color="#FF0000"><b><i>Please note:</i></b></font>
<ul>A really <b>successful virus diagnosis</b> requires that you have made provisions at a time when your system still was "clean". Most virus scanners allow to create a <b>boot disk</b> to start a diagnosis session without giving any virus a chance to become active. You are happy if you have such a boot disk, and you are even happier if you have recently updated signature files for your virus scanner!</ul></p>
