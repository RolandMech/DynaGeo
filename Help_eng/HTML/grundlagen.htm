<P>DynaGeo is a geometry drawing program that produces <b>dynamic drawings</b>. You can choose which geometrical object you wish to produce, using the menu commands or clicking the appropriate symbol on the toolbar, and enter the data for that object. DynaGeo then draws that object on the screen.</P>

<P>If you have produced multiple objects you can change the drawing by <A HREF="JavaScript:HHCTRL.TextPopup(pop_drag,popfont,10,10,-1,-1)" Title="Click to see a definition!">dragging</A> a <A HREF="JavaScript:HHCTRL.TextPopup(pop_baseobj,popfont,10,10,-1,-1)" Title="Click to see a definition!">basis object</A> with the mouse. All objects the position of which depend on that basis object’s position are then <b>automatically updated</b> so that the drawing looks as if it had been originally drawn in the new position.</P>

<P>DynaGeo contains a powerful <b>context sensitive help function</b>: if you don't know
how to go further, press the F1 key from anywhere within the program, and DynaGeo will show you a help for the actual situation.</P>

<P>DynaGeo drawings may be <b>saved</b> and <b>loaded</b> as well as <b>exported</b> via the clipboard and of course <b>printed</b>. The data file format used is a special one, and data files carry the standard extension <i>GEO</i>.</P>

<P>You may <b>measure</b> the present distance between any objects as well as the angles. Additionally, you may enter formulas or <a href="termsyntax.htm">expressions</a> in which these measurements are used as variables. The value of these variables are also updated when you <A HREF="JavaScript:HHCTRL.TextPopup(pop_drag,popfont,10,10,-1,-1)" Title="Click to see a definition!">drag</A> an object and the new values displayed.</P>

<P>If a number of construction steps should be carried out several times in the same way, you can create a <b>macro</b>, and thus expand the abilities of EUKLID DynaGeo. Macros can be saved and loaded. The presently active Macro commands are automatically displayed as additional menu items in the Macro menu of the DynaGeo window.</P>

<P>After a construction has been made, it is possible to <b>replay</b> and see the sequence of the construction steps again on the screen, just like a film. You can add comments to your drawing by using a <b>textbox</b> object. So you can give some hints to your user or present a problem to be solved. If required, you can display a <b>construction text</b> in an extra window.</P>

<P>Every DynaGeo drawing contains a Cartesian <b>co-ordinate system</b> with a unit length of 1 cm. This allows to produce points with given co-ordinates. When a drawing without co-ordinates is preferred the co-ordinate system may be hidden.</P>

<P>DynaGeo offers many <b>construction commands</b>. But you can also limit the commands available by choosing different command sets from a <b>configuration menu</b>. So a teacher can make the students construct a perpendicular bisector using elementary basic tools (i.e. compass and ruler) instead of the perpendicular bisector command. You can even create your personal command sets.</P>

<P>A DynaGeo drawing can theoretically consist of as many objects as you can fit into your computer’s RAM. With drawings of this complexity, however, the <A HREF="JavaScript:HHCTRL.TextPopup(pop_drag,popfont,10,10,-1,-1)"
Title="Click to see a definition!">dragging</A> process can be somewhat laborious. The required calculations and (especially) graphic outputs need a fast computer fitted with a speedy graphic card.</P>
