<H2>Problems with scaling</H2>
<HR>

<P><B>a) Scaling on the screen:</B></P>

<blockquote><P>EUKLID DynaGeo tries to start every new drawing with a scale of 1:1. So it has to find out how many screen pixel make up an inch, and it asks WINDOWS about that. When WINDOWS finds that there is a 15 inch monitor connected, run with 1024 x 768 pixels, then the result is so-many pixels per centimetre. This information is transferred to EUKLID DynaGeo, and it is started so that a line segment of 5 cm occupies exactly 5 WINDOWS-cm on the screen. But due to the poor resolution of the actually available screens, usually the WINDOWS screen centimetre is about 50% longer than the real world centimeter.</P>

<p>In the meantime, EUKLID DynaGeo has learned to <b>zoom</b> the whole drawing. So you can freely adjust the scale at your demands.</p>

<P><B>b) Scaling on the printer:</B></P>

<blockquote><P>If the scaling factor is set to 1.00 (in the <a href="druckeropt.htm">Printer options dialogue</a>), then the
drawing is printed as if WINDOWS believed the scale is 1:1, i.e. every WINDOWS centimeter will be converted to a printer centimeter. As printers are generally more truthful than monitors, this is mostly almost correct. However, using a scaling factor &gt; 1.00 ( &lt; 1.00 ) allows the print-out to be expanded (or contracted).</P>
