<H2>Problems with object representation on the screen:</H2>
<HR>

<P><B>a) Why do parts of lines sometimes remain on the screen?</B></P>

<blockquote><P>Sometimes when you drag an object it is not deleted completely at its old position before it is displayed at the new one. So some ugly pixel traces remain on the screen. This seems to be a problem of some graphic driver software. Try to get an <b>update for your graphic display driver</b>. Most graphic card manufacturer provide appropriate updates on their internet pages. </P>

<P>To delete these pixel traces, open the context menu of the drawing and choose the item <I>Refresh drawing</I>. Alternatively, you can press the <I>U</I> key to make a "screen <I><B>U</B></I>pdate"!</P>

<P><B>b) Why do some straight lines not show?</B></P>

<blockquote><P>On some few computer systems, EUKLID DynaGeo correctly draws line segments, but no (long) lines. This is due to a faulty graphics driver which fails to clip lines correctly. In many cases, an update of the graphic display driver will fix the problem. </P>
