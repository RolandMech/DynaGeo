<HR>

<P>With this command you can control the <b>mutual overlapping</b> of areas: </P>

<P>when you click on an area that is <b>partially covered</b> by another one, then the clicked area is put into the foreground; so it becomes totally visible and the other polygon is covered to some extent.</P>

<p>It is even possible to bring a <b>totally covered</b> area to the foreground if only you know its name: every area automatically gets a name, that starts with "F_" and continues with a number. If you choose the <i>Bring area to foreground</i> command and click at a spot where several areas overlap, a listbox comes up to let you choose the desired one.</p>
