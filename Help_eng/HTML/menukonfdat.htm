<H2>Options | Option data file menu</H2>
<HR>

<P>The local menu of the <I>Options</I> window contains the following six items:</P>
<ul>
<li><p><b>Load default settings</b><br>
This commmand resets all options to their standard values.</p></li>

<li><p><b>Load user settings</b><br>
This command allows you to reload your personal settings. Normally, this is done at every program start automatically. But if you change your actual configuration (without saving it!) this command allows to return to the settings that were saved last.</p></li>

<li><p><b>Save actual user settings</b><br>
This command allows to save your actual settings. They will be reloaded automatically at the next start of the program in order to restore the program state of your last DynaGeo session. </p></li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>The last three menu items are only <b>for DynaGeo administrators</b>. A DynaGeo administrator is a user that has write access to the central configuration file DYNAGEO.INI in the DynaGeo directory. "Normal users" can only <u>read</u> this file. So, the following menu items appear disabled.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><b>Save actual user settings as standard</b><br>
This command lets the administrator save <u>his personal settings</u> as <u>standard settings for all users</u>. The administrator can force the users to work with these standard settings by blocking the use of personal configuration data in the <a href="netopt.htm">Network options</a>.</p>
</li>

<li><p><b>Actualize the license data</b><br>
This command allows you import new license data e.g. after an upgrade of your license. Actually, the license data file is copied to the DynaGeo directory, and so you must have write access there! Normally, there is no need to use this command.</p>
</li>

<li><p><b>Network options...</b><br>
This command opens a dialogue where the administrator can prescribe if the other users can work with their personal configuration or if they are forced to take the standard settings. For further details see the page about <a href="netopt.htm">Network options</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<br>
<P>Normally, your personal settings are saved automatically whenever you close the program. So you may hardly feel the need to use the first three menu items. The last three menu items should also be used only if you know exactly what you do.</P>
