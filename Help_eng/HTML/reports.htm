<H3><a href="jumpingpoints.htm">The problem of the "Jumping points"</a></H3>
<ul>This small article shows a classical problem of "Dynamic geometry systems" that has kept the DGS programmers busy over a couple of years. In the meantime we've learned that the problem is unsolvable.
</ul>
</p>

<p>
<H3><a href="intersections.htm">The problem of the intersection</a></H3>
<ul>In this section you learn about a very basic problem of the classical geometry that leads to unexpectedly  difficult questions when you produce your drawings with a DGS and therefore they become "moveable". </ul>
</p>
<br>
<p>
<H3><a href="recurs_fkt.htm">The problem of the recursive functions</a></H3>
<ul>Here you get a little introduction to the difficulties you will be faced with when you want to draw the graphs of recursive functions with a DGS like DynaGeo. </ul>
</p>
<br>
<p>
<H3><a href="angle_unit.htm">The problem of the angle unit</a></H3>
<ul>Some background information how DynaGeo measures angle widths. A detailed example shows you how to get along with the mess the mathematicians caused by not deciding the struggle between "deg" and "rad".</ul>
