<li><p>If your EUKLID DynaGeo behaves strangely or has any kind of errors, then first try this help file.</p></li>

<li><p>When you cannot find anything helpful there, please look at the <a href="http://www.dynageo.com">EUKLID DynaGeo homepage</a> to see if there can be found anything about your problem.</p></li>

<li><p> If not, send me an <a href="mailto:roland@mechling.de">e-mail</a> with a problem description and perhaps an attached GEO file showing the problem (if several then please ZIP them!).<br>
The more accurate your bug description, the greater the chances I can help you! Always include some information about your hardware (processor speed, graphic card, memory) and software (operation system version, network software)!<br>
In any case I shall try to help you as fast as possible.</p></li>
