<H2>Does DynaGeoJ change my Windows?</H2>
<HR>

<ul>
<P>DynaGeoJ is a normal <b>JAVA-Applet</b> that is managed automatically by WINDOWS itself. Whenever the browser is to show a HTML page that needs DynaGeoJ, the applet is downloaded according to the data of the &lt;APPLET&gt;-Tag in the HTML text of the page, either from the web if there is an URL provided, or from the local file system if there is only a relative path. The applet is started and loads the drawing from the GEO file given in the "param" tag inside the &lt;APPLET&gt;-Tag. Finally it displays the drawing in a window with the desired extensions "width" and "height".</P>

<P>Though during the installation of DynaGeo on your computer one version of the DynaGeoJ applet is put into the "DynaGeo\Viewer" folder, in most cases the browser will perform a new download of the JAR archive from the web. How the browser gets a runnable instance of the DynaGeoJ applet is decided only by the data in the &lt;APPLET&gt;-Tag.</P>
