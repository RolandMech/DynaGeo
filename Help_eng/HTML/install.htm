<H2>Installation on a single computer</H2>
<HR>
<br>
<p>If you have one of the newer versions of WINDOWS (NT, 2000, XP,...) then <b>for every installation</b> it is necessary that you are logged in with administrator rights. If you are logged in as "normal user", you will not be able to write into your "program files" directory and its subdirectories.</p>

<P>To install a licensed version of DynaGeo, you need the following two files:
<ol start="1" type="1">
<li><b>a big self-extracting archive, e.g. "edg36d.exe":</b><br>
this is an executable file that contains an installation program and all of the files that belong to a full EUKLID DynaGeo distribution. You can download the latest version of this file from the <nobr><a href="http://www.dynageo.com">EUKLID DynaGeo homepage</a></nobr>.<br>
<br>
</li>
<li><b>a license file, e.g. "RolandMechling00.dgl":</b><br>
this small file contains your personal license in encrypted form. The file's name may be derived from the customer's name, but this is not necessary. DynaGeo license files always have the file extension ".dgl". <br>
</ol>
Please make sure, that these two files are in the <b>same directory</b> before you start the installation. If you got an installation CD from the manufacturer, these two files are in its root directory.</p>

<p>Start the archive EXE file, e.g. by double-clicking it in the WINDOWS explorer. During installation you can choose a directory for the program files. In most cases, it is sufficient to confirm the default values offered. Then the install program copies the files to your hard disk. Finally, DynaGeo is started for the first time on your computer. If there is a valid license data file next to the installation archive, it is copied into the DynaGeo directory. Then the installation is complete. </P>

<P>If during the first program start no DGL file is found then the installed program remains a shareware version - and so will stop working when the test phase of 8 weeks is over.</P>
