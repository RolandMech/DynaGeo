<P>A standard file dialogue window is opened and you can select a graphic file. The supported file formats are:<br>
<ul><b>bmp</b>, <b>jpg</b>, <b>jpeg</b>, <b>wmf</b>, <b>emf</b> and <b>png</b>.    </ul>
The window shows the graphic files that have been found in the current folder. You can also navigate to another folder or change the drive to get access to graphic files stored in other places. When you click the <I>Okay</I> button, the selected graphic file is loaded and will be used as a background picture for your drawing.</P>
<br>

<p>The <b>context menu</b> of a such a picture holds the following entries:<br>
<ul>
<li><b>Hide picture </b>:<br>
<ul>This commmand hides the picture. It works just like the "Hide" command of any other object.<br>
</ul><br>
</li>
<li><b>Show frame / Fix picture </b>:<br>
<ul>Normally, a background picture has a fixed extension at a fixed place. After loading, the picture is located in the middle of the actual window and displayed without a frame. In this state, you cannot change neither the size nor the position of the picture.<br>
When you select the command <b>"Show frame"</b>, a gray frame is drawn around the picture. In this state, you can drag the picture as a whole, and you can change its height and width by dragging the frame lines. If you want to change the size without changing the aspect, you can drag the corners of the frame. <br>
When the picture has the right position and the desired extensions, you should carry out the <b>"Fix picture"</b> command. This will hide the frame and so protect the picture against accidental manipulations.<br>
</ul><br>
</li>
<br>
</ul>
</p>

<P><font color="#FF0000"><b><i>Please note:</i></b></font>
<ul>The graphic files are not just linked into your drawing but <u>embedded</u>. So subsequent changes to the original files have no effect on the pictures imported in your drawing. </ul>
