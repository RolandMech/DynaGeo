<H2>Edit Copyright note</H2>
<HR>
<br>
This command opens a window where you can edit the Copyright text for your actual drawing.<br>
<br>
<br>
<ol start="1" type="1">
<li>In a <font color="#0000FF">first section <i>"Copyright note"</i></font> you can add a <b>copyright note</b> to your drawings provided you have a licenced version of DynaGeo installed. This copyright note can only be edited by you. For other users, this edit field appears disabled and cannot be edited when your drawing is loaded.<br>
<br>
<font color="#FF0000"><b><i>Attention !</i></b></font>
<ul>Your Copyright note ist <B>not a write protection</B> for the contents of your drawing! Every other user may do further work on his copy of your drawing. Only editing of the Copyright note is disabled, and every copy of the file that originally contained your drawing will carry your Copyright note, even if it is saved under another file name. <br>
</ul>
<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>In a <font color="#0000FF">second section <i>"Actual file attributes"</i></font> appear the <b>file name</b>, the <B>creation date</B> of the file, the <b>date of the last editing</b> and the <nobr><b>DynaGeo version</b></nobr> with which the file was last edited. Furthermore, the actual <b>file size</b> is shown. These data cannot be edited here - they are shown only for information.<br>
</li>
</ol>
<br>
<br>
<p>If you close the window by a click on the <i>"Okay"</i> button in the upper right corner, then your Copyright note is written to your drawing. If you take the <i>"Cancel"</i> button, your changes are discarded.</p>
