<P>Indicate the original object and the circle in which the object is to be reflected. Then the reflected object is created and displayed.</P>

<P><b><i>Please note:</i></b>
<ul>
<li>This command is restricted to map only <b>points, lines</b> and <b>circles</b>.<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>If you let repeat this command automatically, all subsequent reflection will use the circle of the first one. So all original objects are reflected in the same circle! <br>

<P><B><I>What's that, a reflection in a circle?</I></B>
<ul>
<P>The reflection in a circle is not yet equally known as the congruent transformations and the similarity transformations. So here is a definition: if P is to be reflected in a cirle c(M,r) with centre M and radius r, then the image point of P is that unique point P' on the ray [MP), that satisfies the equation: |MP| * |MP'| = r&sup2;.</P>

<p>If P is <u>inside</u> the circle c, then you can construct P' according to the following sketch: <br>
<br>
<div align="center"><img src="../images/Kreisspiegelung.png" alt="Elementare Kreisspiegelung" border="0"></div>
<br>
This construction fails if P moves <u>outside</u> the circle c. Then T does no longer exist. But actually, you only need to change the roles of P and P'! Maybe this hint is sufficient to let you find an appropriate construction by yourself. If you need some more help, you can find it in Milet...   ;-)</P>

<p>And with some more efforts, you may even find an elementary construction that leads from P to P' for all possible positions of P!
</p>

<p>The reflection in a circle is a rather interesting transformation, because it does <u>not preserve the straight line property</u> as we are used when looking at congruent or affine transformations. Instead it maps circles to circles! (In this context, straight lines can be seen as circles with infinite radius.) Only the lines running through the centre of the reflection circle are mapped to straight lines - they are even fix elements of this reflection. All other straight lines are mapped to circles. Just play some time with this command to get used to the secrets of this somehow strange mapping!</p>
