<H3>Automatic selection</H3>

<P>When in "Edit" mode you click at a point of your screen where there are <B>several objects</B>, DynaGeo tries to find out which one you mean. For this, every kind of object has a characteristic <b>priority</b> according to the following list (ordered by decreasing priority):</P>

<P><B>points / line segments / lines / circles / names / measures / polygones.</B></P>

<P>If by using this priority list, DynaGeo is able to decide without doubt which object you want, the program will use this object without further enquiry. But when the cursor is at a spot where e.g. two line segments may be meant but no point, then DynaGeo shows a selection dialog, where you can decide which of the two line segments you want to edit.</P>

<P>While you create or delete objects the automatic selection is disabled. This helps to avoid that the wrong object is processed by mistake. </P>
