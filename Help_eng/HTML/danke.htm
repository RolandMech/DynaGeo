<H2>Thanks</H2>
<HR>

<P>First of all I wish to thank <b>my wife</b> who in the difficult time of program development supported her computer addicted husband with patience and constructive help. My thanks also go to my colleagues who taught me the techniques of programming, like <b>Bernd Ebbmeier</b>, <b>Dr. Klaus Heidler</b> and <b>Dr. Konrad Dammeier</b>. </P>

<P>Then I am indepted to <B>Prof. Jean-Marie Laborde</B> at the University of Grenoble, who at the end of the 80's with his program "Cabri g&eacute;om&egrave;tre" founded the dynamic computer geometry in Europe. Many authors of "DGS" programs owe much to him - and so do I.</p>

<p>My special thanks go to <B>Hans-J&uuml;rgen Elschenbroich</B> for his discerning but always encouraging comments and his helpful advices concerning didactic issues. Furthermore I want to thank <b>Ulli Kortenkamp</b> for the mental adventure of reading his documentation about the mathematics behind "Cinderella". And finally I thank <b>Markus Hohenwarter</b> for publishing the documentation of his famous program "GeoGebra": reading his texts gave me some valuable private lessons about the mathematics of conics.</P>

<P>Finally, I want to thank <b>my busy students</b> from the "best GKInf ever", our famous computer science course in 2005/06, who set the "DynaGeoJ" project on the rails. And I also thank their successors in 2010/11 who helped me on the long road to "DynaGeoJ 1.0". </P>
