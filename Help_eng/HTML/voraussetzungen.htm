<P>DynaGeo 3 is a 32-bit WINDOWS program and will run on all "modern" WINDOWS versions (as 2000 / XP / Vista /...), even if you use a 64-bit-WINDOWS. DynaGeo 3 should run on any computer that matches the hardware recommendations of its operating system.</p>

<p>The program itself is rather small: it occupies less than 10 MB on your hard disk. To get a smooth dragging mode you should have <b>a speedy graphic card</b>. Though the program does not need any particular screen resolution it is recommended to use at least a 1024*768 dot screen. On lower resolution there can be some crowding in the toolbars.</p>

<P>DynaGeo can also be used in most of the popular local area network operating systems. Especially on NOVELL and WINDOWS networks it has proved to run safely and reliably. </P>
